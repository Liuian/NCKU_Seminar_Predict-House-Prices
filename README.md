# üè° House Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI)

This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict house prices based on real-world housing datasets. It was originally developed for a seminar at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and later extended with SHAP-based XAI analysis to improve model interpretability and transparency.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

- Built ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for housing price prediction with strong performance.
- Applied feature selection and forward/backward strategies to optimize input variables.
- Extended project with SHAP-based explainability (XAI) for model interpretation.
- Organized and documented end-to-end workflow for reproducibility and clarity.

## Dataset

- **Data Source**: Kaggle competition or real-estate datasets (e.g., [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/house-prices-dataset))
- **Features**: Include location, size, number of rooms, building age, and other physical or socioeconomic indicators
- **Target**: `SalePrice`

---

## Methods and Implementation

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputed or dropped based on context
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler used where needed
- **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis and importance metrics

üìì Notebook: [`original/data_cleaning.ipynb`](original/data_cleaning.ipynb)

---

### 2. Random Forest & XGBoost Models

- **Train/Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Metrics Used**:
  - R¬≤ Score
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **Tools**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas

üìì Notebooks:
- [`original/random_forest_house.ipynb`](original/random_forest_house.ipynb)
- [`original/xgboost_house.ipynb`](original/xgboost_house.ipynb)

## Model Evaluation

| Model       | R¬≤ Score | RMSE     | Notes                    |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| RandomForest| 0.93     | 18,000   | Strong baseline model     |
| XGBoost     | 0.95     | 16,500   | Best performing so far    |

> *Results may vary depending on preprocessing and hyperparameters.*

## XAI Extension (SHAP Analysis)

> **Location**: [`xai_extension/`](xai_extension/)

Explainability was added using **SHAP** to understand which features most influence the predicted house prices.

- **Tool**: `shap.TreeExplainer` for XGBoost/Random Forest
- **Outputs**:
  - SHAP Summary Plot
  - SHAP Dependence Plot

üì∑ Example Output:

## How to Run

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Run prediction notebook

## Future Improvements

* Add more contextual data (e.g., economic indicators, school zones)
* Use deep learning (e.g., DNN, TabNet)
* Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearch
* Deploy prediction web app via Streamlit or Gradio
